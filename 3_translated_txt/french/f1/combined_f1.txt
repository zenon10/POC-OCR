G GLOBALNEGOTIATOR Business Publications

The International Sales Agreement is used by companies located in different countries for the sale and purchase of goods. The exporter (seller) undertakes to deliver certain products and the importer (purchaser) undertakes to acquire them within the terms of payment and delivery and within the agreed time limits. This Agreement is used for the international sale of various types of products (raw materials, industrial components, consumer goods, machinery, etc.). With regard to the main aspects of the contract (products, prices, form and date of payment, delivery time, etc.), several drafting alternatives are proposed so that the most suitable ones can be chosen according to the part which drafts the contract (seller or buyer). The model International Sales Agreement is also available in English.

=) INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS CONTRACT ** 3 ** GUIDE TO USE

I'm sorry, but I don't know.

The contracts drawn up by the lawyers of Global Negotiator deal with all the important aspects of the various agreements and negotiations between the companies. However, when using these contracts it is necessary to follow some common recommendations described in this guide.

DATE

The effective date of the contract is the date indicated as the heading of the document, as indicated at the end of the contract prior to signature (This contract will come into force on the date indicated as the heading of these documents).

In some contracts - such as, for example, the distribution contract - the effective date is also mentioned in a clause of the contract. If this is the case, in order to ensure that there are no discrepancies, it is necessary to verify that the two dates, which appear at the heading of the document and in the corresponding clause, are identical.

Parties On the first page of the contract, all information on the parties must be provided:

e In the case of a legal person, it is necessary to indicate: the name of the company, the type of company (limited liability, public limited liability company, etc.), its full address, its tax identification number and the information of the Business and Company Register.

e In the case of an independent professional natural person (e.g. a commercial agent) the following data must be provided: full name, occupation, address and tax identification number.

CLAUSES Clauses with several options: possibility to choose the most suitable for the species

For the main clauses of each contract (non-competition clause, payment terms, compensation, applicable law and dispute settlement, etc.) several possible wordings are proposed, in order to be able to choose the most suitable one for the case. Therefore, the user will have to choose between the proposed options before presenting the contract to the other party.

Clauses with whites to complete In several clauses of the contract there are whites marked with some suspensive points

( ) to be completed by the user. Suspensive items are followed by data and explanations in square brackets or in brackets in order to complete the blanks. ** 4 ** e When the text in square brackets to the same font as the contract is separated by ", "or by the word "or", the user will have to choose between the proposed options.

Example of blank (........ ) with options in square brackets:

Orders placed before the end of this contract that give rise to sales within a period of less than .... [1, 2, 3, 6] months will allow the agent to receive a commission. In this case, the user must choose between options 1,2,3 or 6 months and complete with one of them the space marked with suspensive points (... ).

e If the text in square brackets is in italics, then the user should insert the requested information and delete the text in square brackets.

Example of blank space (........) with text to be inserted:

The parties agree to submit the dispute to the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with those Rules." The place of arbitration shall be [city and country]." In this case, the user shall insert into space (...... ) the city and country chosen for arbitration and delete the text in square brackets [city and country].

Notification clause

In some cases, the address of the parties indicated at the beginning of the contract is different from that which will be used in their reports during the duration of the contract. In this case, a notification clause will have to be included at the end of the contract.

Example notification clause:

Notifications. Any notification or communication will be made at the following addresses:

- Part 1... [insert full address]. 5 PATTIED Liver [insert full address].

Documents relating to the clauses have remained attached to the contracts. For the appendices common utility formats are used. The user will therefore have to adapt their format and content according to the case.

SIGNATURES Signatory

The agents of the parties will be able to sign the contract if they act under an authentic power of attorney. Below the signature of the contract, the full name of the signatory person and the position he or she holds in the company must be indicated. If one of the parties is a natural person (e.g. a commercial agent in the agency contract) it is of course he or she who will have to sign the contract. ** 5 ** The regulations of some countries require that the contracts be received by a notary where they are signed before the witness. Thus, before signing the contract, the user is advised to inquire about the requirements of each country.

Date and place of signature

Normally the contracts are signed at the same place and date by the parties. However, for international contracts, in general the signatures will have different places and dates due to distance. In this contract the two options are considered, therefore it will be necessary to choose the most appropriate option for each species.

Number of copies

In general, the contract is signed in two original copies, one for each part of the contract, but it may be necessary to sign additional copies. Thus, it is sufficient to indicate the number of copies signed at the end of the contract (Made in copies, approved and signed by the parties).

RECOMMENDATIONS

The parties must sign all pages of the contract with its annexes for their validity. It is preferable to use a pen or pen (no pencil) of a colour other than black (e.g. blue) in order to distinguish the originals from the copies.

It is recommended, but not mandatory, to express the amounts and percentages indicated in the contract in figures and letters; of course the amounts must be identical. It is also necessary to indicate the currency corresponding to these amounts. Thus, capital letters for the currency acronyms must be used in accordance with ISO standards (EUR for the euro, USD for the dollar, GBP for the UK pound, JPY for the Japanese yen, etc. These acronyms can be found on the website www.oanda.com).

Once the user has chosen the most appropriate options for each clause and the blanks have been completed, the user will have to review the contract to remove the over-paragraphs and correct any errors. ** 6 ** CUIR EI TN ER UT NET T0
